title: Introduction to Design Patterns
description: Introduces about Design Patterns, importance of Design Patterns, and how to implement Design Patterns in your code.
---
A pattern (or design pattern) is a written document that describes a general solution 
to a design problem that occurs repeatedly in many projects. 

## Information about

- Name that describes the pattern
- Problem to be solved by the pattern
- Context, or settings, in which the problem occurs
- Solution proposed to the problem
- Context for the solution
- Author and date information
- Sample code related to the solution, if it helps


## Structure of Design Pattern

| Term            | Description                                                                                                                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pattern Name    | Describes the essence of the pattern in a short, but expressive, name                                                           |
| Intent          | Describes what the pattern does                                                                                                 |
| Also Known As   | List any synonyms for the pattern                                                                                               |
| Motivation      | Provides an example of a problem and how the pattern solves that problem                                                        |
| Applicability   | Lists the situations where the pattern is applicable                                                                            |
| Structure       | Set of diagrams of the classes and objects that depict the pattern                                                              |
| Participants    | Describes the classes and objects that participate in the design pattern and their responsibilities                             |
| Collaborations  | Describes how the participants collaborate to carry out their responsibilities                                                  |
| Consequences    | Describes the forces that exist with the pattern and the benefits, trade-offs, and the variable that is isolated by the pattern |

## Importance of Design Patterns

- It makes code reusable, bug-free, and clean.
- Speed up development process.
- Changes or modification become easier.
- Reduce common problems of developers they face during development process.
- Improve object oriented skill.
- Easy to understand the flow of code.
- Less code so easy to maintain.
