> How XML binding can be achieved in Java ?

- Java offers several options for handling XML structures and files. 
- One of the most common and used ones is JAXB. 
- JAXB stands for Java Architecture for XML Binding. 
- It offers the possibility to convert Java objects into XML structures and the other way around. 
- JAXB comes with the JRE standard bundle since the first versions of the JRE 1.6.
- JAXB Binding gives Java developers an efficient and standard way of mapping between XML and Java code. 
- Java developers using JAXB Binding are more productive because they can write less code themselves and do not have to be experts in XML. 
- JAXB Binding makes it easier for developers to extend their applications with XML and Web Services technologies.


The binding process includes following steps:  

1. Binding
    - Binding a schema means generating a set of Java classes that represents the schema.
2. Marshalling
    - Convert Java objects into XML structures.
3. Unmarshalling
    - Convert XML structures into Java objects.
