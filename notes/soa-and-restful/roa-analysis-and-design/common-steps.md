1. Figure out the dataset.
2. Split the dataset into resources.
3. For each resource.
     - Name the resource with a URI.
         - 3 basic rules to name the resources with URLS:
            - Use path variables to encode hierarchical relationship: `parent/child`.
            - Use punctuation characters to separate children: `parent/child1;child2`.
            - Use query variables to imply input to the resource: `parent?child=child1`.
     - Expose a subset of the uniform interface.
     - Design the representation accepted from the client.
     - Design the representation served to the client.
     - Integrate the resource with other resources using links and forms.
     - Consider the typical course of events: whatâ€™s supposed to happen?
     - Consider error conditions: what might go wrong?
