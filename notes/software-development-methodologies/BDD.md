BDD is software development process that emerges from test driven development.  
BDD combines the general technique of principles of TDD with ideas from Domain Driven Design and Analysis and design to provide software development and management, teams with shared tools and a shared process to collaborate on software development.


BDD is largely faciliated throught the use of a simple domain specific language using natural language constructs that can express the behaviour and the expected outcomes.  
BDD is considered an effective technical practice especially then the problem space of the business problem to solve is complex.


## Principles of BDD
1. BDD specifies that tests of any unit of software should be specified in terms of the desired behavior of the unit.
2. BDD, also related to howt othe desired behaviour should be specified.
3. BDD specified business analysis and developer should collaborate and should specify behaviour in terms of user stories.
