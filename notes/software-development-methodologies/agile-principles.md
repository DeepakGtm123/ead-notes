## Introduction

AGILE software development is an approach to software devlopment under which requirements and solution evolve throught the collaborative effort of self organizing and cross functionalities and their customer/end users.

The key in AGILE technique is compressing the five sequences of the conventional software development method called Waterfall method to about one week cycle.  
It manages to do this by developing a system through repetitive cycle (iterative) and in small portions (incremental), allowing developers to test and review during development.

## Principles
The manifesto for AGILE Software Development is based in 12 Principles.

1. Customer Satisfaction by early and continous deliveryof valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirement even in late development.
3. Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than month).
4. Close and daily co-operation between customer and developer.
5. Projects are build around motivated individuals whom could be trusted. 
6. Face to face conversation is best form of communication co-location.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Sustainable development would able to maintain a constant pace.
9. Continous attention to technical excellence of good design.
10. Simplicity-the art of maximizing the amount of work not doneâ€“is essential .
11. Best Architectures, Requirements and design emerge from self organizing teams.
12. Regularly Reflect and Adjust Your Way of Work to Boost Effectiveness.
