> TDD = TFD + Refactoring, TFD = Test First Development 

## Introduction

It is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle. 

1. Requirements are turned into very specific test cases.
2. Then the software is improved to pass the new test only.
3. TDD is related to the test first programming concept of XP ( Extreme Programming ).

TDD Starts with development of test for each one of the feature.   
The test might fail as the test are developed even before the development.  
Development team then develops and refactors the code to pass the test.

## TDD Sequuences

1. Add a test.
2. Run all tests and see if the new test fails.
3. Write the code that causes the test to pass.
4. Run tests.
5. Refactor code.
6. Continue process from step 1 to 5.

## Benefits of TDD
1. The software design becomes modular.
2. The code is easier to maintain.
3. Code refactoring goes more smoothly.
4. Project costs decrease, ROI increases.
5. TDD documents the code better.
6. Developers have less debugging to do.
7. Shorter development cycle.
8. Near 0 (zero) Defects.
9. Test becomes safety net.
10. Code proven to meet requirements.

## Cons of TDD
1. Slows down the development process.
2. TDD Approach is difficult to learn relatively.
3. It is an "All or None" approach.
4. It is challenging to support and maintain.
