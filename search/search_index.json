Convention Coding conventions are a set of guidelines for a specific programming language that recommend programming style, practices, and methods for each aspect of a program written in that language. Convention over Configuration Convention over configuration is a software development approach geared toward developing programs according to typical programming conventions, versus programmer defined configurations. It enables quick and simple software creation while maintaining base software requirements. Convention over configuration is also known as coding by convention. Convention over configuration relies on the development of a program through the use of an underlying language\u2019s native procedures, functions, classes and variables. This approach reduces or eliminates the need for additional software configuration files, ultimately facilitating and expediting software development, code consistency and maintenance. However, to follow these conventions, a software developer must be acquainted with the underlying framework. Definition Convention over configuration (also known as coding by convention) is a software design paradigm used by software frameworks that attempts to decrease the number of decisions that a developer using the framework is required to make without necessarily losing flexibility and Don't repeat yourself (DRY) principles. Example : The phrase essentially means a developer only needs to specify unconventional aspects of the application. For example, if there is a class Sales in the model, the corresponding table in the database is called \"sales\" by default. It is only if one deviates from this convention, such as the table \"product sales\", that one needs to write code regarding these names. Motivation Some frameworks need multiple configuration files, each with many settings. These provide information specific to each project, ranging from URLs to mappings between classes and database tables. Many configuration files with many parameters are often difficult to maintain. Usage Many modern frameworks use a convention over configuration approach. The concept is older, however, dating back to the concept of a default, and can be spotted more recently in the roots of Java libraries. For example, the JavaBeans specification relies on it heavily. To quote the JavaBeans specification. The Maven software tool auto-generated this directory structure for a Java project. Benefit Benefit of convention over configuration paradigm in web development the productivity since you won't be required to configured to set all the rules and there are less decision that a programmer has to make . Disadvantage Disadvantages of the convention over configuration approach can occur due to conflicts with other software design principles, like the Zen of Python 's \"explicit is better than implicit.\"","title":"Convention vs Configuration"},{"location":"design-patterns/convention-vs-configuration/#configuration","text":"Configuration is the manner in which components(variables, classes, interfaces, templates etc.) are arranged to make up the application.","title":"Configuration"},{"location":"design-patterns/convention-vs-configuration/#convention","text":"Coding conventions are a set of guidelines for a specific programming language that recommend programming style, practices, and methods for each aspect of a program written in that language.","title":"Convention"},{"location":"design-patterns/convention-vs-configuration/#convention-over-configuration","text":"Convention over configuration is a software development approach geared toward developing programs according to typical programming conventions, versus programmer defined configurations.

It is a way to decouple the code from the way it is implemented. It removes the dependency from the programming code so that it can be easy to manage and test the application. It makes our programming code loosely coupled. Dependency injection is a way to create your dependencies outside of the class that uses it. You inject them from the outside, and take control about their creation away from the inside of your class. This is also why dependency injection is a realization of the Inversion of control (IoC) principle. Dependency Inversion Principle High-level modules should not import anything from low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces). Abstractions should not depend on details. Details (concrete implementations) should depend on abstractions. Inversion of Control It means to create instance of the dependencies first and latter instance of the class, instead of creating an instance of the class first and then creating instance of the dependencies. It inverts the flow of control of the program execution. Instead of callee controlling the flow of control (while creating dependencies) of the program execution, caller controls the flow of control. Purpose of IOC To decouple the execution of a task from implementation. To focus a module on the task it is designed for. To free modules from assumptions about how other systems do what they do and instead rely on contracts. To prevent side effects when replacing a module. Inversion of control is sometimes humorously referred to as the \" Hollywood Principle: Don't call us, we'll call you \". Spring IOC Container An IoC container is a common characteristic of frameworks that implement IoC. In the Spring framework, the interface ApplicationContext represents the IoC container. The Spring container is responsible for instantiating, configuring and assembling objects known as beans, as well as managing their life cycles The Spring framework provides several implementations of the ApplicationContext interface: ClassPathXmlApplicationContext and FileSystemXmlApplicationContext for standalone applications, and WebApplicationContext for web applications. In order to assemble beans, the container uses configuration metadata, which can be in the form of XML configuration or annotations. Here's one way to manually instantiate a container: ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext ( \"applicationContext.xml\" ); To set the item attribute in the example above, we can use metadata. Then the container will read this metadata and use it to assemble beans at runtime.

Pattern & Description 1 Creational Patterns These design patterns provide a way to create objects while hiding the creation logic rather than instantiating objects directly using new operator. This gives program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given use case. Eg: Factory, Singleton etc. 2 Structural Patterns These design patterns concern class and object composition. Concept of inheritance is used to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionalities. Eg: Adapter, Bridge etc. 3 Behavioral Patterns These design patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects. Eg: Observer, Iterator etc. 4 J2EE Patterns These design patterns are specifically concerned with the presentation tier. These patterns are identified by Sun Java Center. Difference between Design Pattern and Framework Pattern A pattern is a way of doing something, or a way of pursuing intent. This idea applies to cooking, making fireworks, developing software, and to any other craft. It is a solution to a problem in a context. Patterns are classified into: Design Pattern, Architectural Pattern, Macro \u2013 Architecture, Micro \u2013 Architecture, Idioms or Coding Patterns, Language Paradigms etc. Design Pattern Design pattern is a category of patterns that deals with object oriented software.

Each code push is then verified by a automated build system, allowing team to detect problem early. By integrating regularly, we can detect error quickly and locate them more easily. Continuous integration is cheap, not integrating continuously is expensive. If we don't follow a continuous approach, you will have a longer periods between integration. This makes it exponentially more difficult to find and fix problems, such integration problems can easily knock a project of schedule or cause it to fail altogether. Making continuous integration works, we need: Source code repository A check-in process An automated build process A willingness to work incrementally. Advantages of CI Increase visibility, enabling better communication. Catch issue early, spend less time debugging and more time in adding feature. Build a solid foundation. Stop waiting to find out if your code's going to work. Reduce integration problems. Reduce the risk of bugs. It supplements the checks like: Automated code quality tests. Check test cases. Syntax style review tools Lints and formats Codebase Martin Fowler CI According to Martin Fowler, CI is composed of 10 key practices: Maintain a single source repository. Automate the build. Make your build self testing. Everyone commits to the mainline every day. Every commit should build the main line on an integration machine. Keep the build fast. Test in a clone of the source in production environment. Make it easy for anyone to get the latest executable. Everyone can see what is happening. Automate deployment. Example : Travis Travis CI is a CI platform that automates the process of software testing and deployment of applications. It\u2019s built as a platform that integrates with your GitHub projects so that you can start testing your code on the fly.

UML stands for Unified Modeling Language. UML is different from the other common programming languages such as C++, Java, COBOL, etc. UML is a pictorial language used to make software blueprints. UML can be described as a general purpose visual modeling language to visualize, specify, construct, and document software system. Although UML is generally used to model software systems, it is not limited within this boundary. It is also used to model non-software systems as well. For example, the process flow in a manufacturing unit, etc. UML Building Blocks Things Relationships Diagrams Things Structural - static part, eg: class, interface, package, etc. Behavioral - dynamic part, eg: interaction, state machine, etc. Grouping - mechanism to group things together, eg: package, etc. Annotational - mechanism to capture remarks, description and comments. show how the elements are associated with each other.

Verification is the static testing. Validation is the dynamic testing. It does not include the execution of the code. It includes the execution of the code. Methods used in verification are reviews, walk-through, inspections and desk-checking. Methods used in validation are Black Box Testing, White Box Testing and non-functional testing. It checks whether the software conforms to specifications or not. It checks whether the software meets the requirements and expectations of a customer or not. It can find the bugs in the early stage of the development. It can only find the bugs that could not be found by the verification process. The goal of verification is application and software architecture and specification. The goal of validation is an actual product. Quality assurance team does verification. Validation is executed on software code with the help of testing team. It comes before validation. It comes after verification. It consists of checking of documents/files and is performed by human. It consists of execution of program and is performed by computer. Test Cases A test case is a set of actions performed on a system to determine if it satisfies software requirements and functions correctly. The purpose of a test case is to determine if different features within a system are performing as expected and to confirm that the system satisfies all related standards, guidelines and customer requirements. The process of writing a test case can also help reveal errors or defects within the system. Test cases are typically written by members of the quality assurance (QA) team or the testing team and can be used as step-by-step instructions for each system test. Testing begins once the development team has finished a system feature or set of features. A sequence or collection of test cases is called a test suite . Benefits Guaranteed good test coverage. Reduced maintenance and software support costs. Reusable test cases. Confirmation that the software satisfies end-user requirements. Improved quality of software and user experience. Higher quality products lead to more satisfied customers. More satisfied customers will increase company profits. Example Book Issue SN Test Cases Expected Result Test Result On Click of 1.

Successful Types of Testing Black Box Testing White Box Testing Grey Box Testing Knowledge of internal working structure (Code) is not required for this type of testing. Only GUI (Graphical User Interface) is required for test cases. Knowledge of internal working structure (Coding of software) is necessarily required for this type of testing. Partially Knowledge of the internal working structure is required. Black Box Testing is also known as functional testing, data-driven testing, and closed box testing. White Box Testing is also known as structural testing, clear box testing, code-based testing, and transparent testing. Grey Box Testing is also known as translucent testing as the tester has limited knowledge of coding. The approach towards testing includes trial techniques and error guessing method because tester does not need knowledge of internal coding of the software. White Box Testing is proceeded by verifying the system boundaries and data domains inherent in the software as there is no lack of internal coding knowledge. If the tester has knowledge of coding, then it is proceeded by validating data domains and internal system boundaries of the software. The testing space of tables for inputs (inputs to be used for creating test cases) is pretty huge and largest among all testing spaces. The testing space of tables for inputs (inputs to be used for creating test cases) is less as compared to Black Box testing. The testing space of tables for inputs (inputs to be used for creating test cases) is smaller than Black Box and White Box testing. It is very difficult to discover hidden errors of the software because errors can be due to internal working which is unknown for Black Box testing.

It offers the possibility to convert Java objects into XML structures and the other way around. JAXB comes with the JRE standard bundle since the first versions of the JRE 1.6. JAXB Binding gives Java developers an efficient and standard way of mapping between XML and Java code. Java developers using JAXB Binding are more productive because they can write less code themselves and do not have to be experts in XML. JAXB Binding makes it easier for developers to extend their applications with XML and Web Services technologies.

A stateless protocol doesn't require server to retain information or status about each use for the duration of the multiple request. HTTP has HTTP cookies.

It is a registry for businesses worldwide to list themselves on the internet. UDDI provides a repository where WSDL files can be hosted so that a client application can discover a WSDL file to learn about the various actions that a web service offers. As a result, the client application will have full access to the UDDI, which serves as a database for all WSDL files. The UDDI registry will hold the required information for the online service, just like a telephone directory has the name, address, and phone number of a certain individual. So that a client application may figure out where it is. WSDL Web Service Description Language It is an XML notation for describing a web service. A WSDL definition tells a client how to compose a web service request. Describes the interface that is provided by web service provided. Why WSDL ? The client invoking the web service should be aware of the location of the web service. Second, the client application must understand what the web service does in order to invoke the correct web service. The WSDL, or Web services description language, is used to accomplish this. STUB (Client Side Proxy) It receives method called from client. It would stored the method details from SOAP request and receive returned values from the SOAP response and hand over to client application. Skeleton ( Server Side Proxy ) It gets method details like parameter, parameter types, return types from SOAP request. It will invoke that client requested method on Service class and get return values. It will store return values in SOAP response. ebXML Electronic Business XML It is a global standard for electronic business that enables anyone, anywhere to do business transactions with anyone over the internet.

Simply calls resources via URL pattern. Result is readble which is just plain XML or JSON. Transfer is over HTTP or HTTPS only. Easy to call from any programming languages. Performance is much better compared to SOAP. Used for light-weight applications like mobile applications, where processing is required at very high speed. For different CRUD operations, it is easy to implement through follwing HTTP methods: Operation HTTP Method Select GET Create POST Update PUT Partial Update PATCH Delete DELETE Search GET List GET Count GET Implementations: Spring Restful, Django Rest Framework etc. Payload in RESTful A payload is a data sent over the internet. When a payload is heavy, it requires more resource. REST tends to use HTTP & JSON which lighten the payload. REST API A REST API (also known as RESTful API) is an application programming interface (API or web API) that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services. It uses HTTP methods to access and use data. Concept and Properties Resource Providers Server that provide resource is resource provider. Eg: AWS, Azure etc. Resource Can be anything such as web pages, Javascript, data. resource will have name and unique path. Resource Representation Resource representation is a way to represent resource. Useful information about the current state of thte resource, specified with specific format, in a specific laguage. Resource Link and Connectedness Resource link means link to the another resource. Connectedness means how reliable and relevant the resource links are. Statelessness Stateless means that the resource is not dependent on the state of the client. Uniform Interface Means all services should be accessed by the client in the same way. Benefits of ROA Achieve performance and scalability because of statelessness. Client and server will have explicit state. No need to establish connection between client and server. SOAP vs REST Factor SOAP REST Definition It is a complete protocol. It is an architectural style as it needs HTTP protocol for the communication. So, it's not a protocol. Architecture - SOA - ROA - Function Driven - Data Driven - Exposes application as service - Exposes resources as service Protocol Any Transfer Protocol - SOAP over HTTP, SOAP over JMS (Java Message Service) HTTP Communication Distributed Communication Client Server Communication Data format Only based on XML Supports XML, JSON, Plaintext etc. Payload It uses XML which is very complex and uses more resource It uses HTTP and JSON so need of extra processing of Payload Security Supports WS-Security which is transport level security. Supports secure version of HTTP i.e. HTTPS Bandwidth Consume or takes more bandwidth due to envelop style and WSDL files. Light weight in terms of design. So, consume less bandwidth. Caching Envelop style requires multiple levels for caching. Its possible to cache data easily. When to use ? Application that requires high security. Eg: Financial App etc. Application that requires high performance, faster response, lightweight payload etc. Eg: Social Media App Ease of use - Client need information about everything before accessing services. - Client need to know only about the payload and URI. - Testing is difficult because of multiple levels of dependency and architecture. - Testing is very easy. RESTful Compliant Architecture RESTful architecture is a set of constraints that define the behavior of a RESTful web service. To design a RESTful web service, you need to follow these six constraints. Uniform Interface Stateless Cacheable Client-Server Layered System Code on Demand (Optional) Uniform Interface All services should be accessed by the client in the same way. For eg: Mobile phone interacts with the servers same way as the laptop interacts with the servers i.e. by using GET, POST, PUT and other HTTP methods. Eg: GET /employees/1 returns { \"id\" : 1 , \"name\" : \"John\" , \"age\" : 30 } Statelessness Server does not depend on the state of the client. All the information to understand a request is contained within a request. Cacheable Server can cache the information to speed up the response. Reduces network latency (access latency).

Agile method is an iterative and incremental tactic to software design that utilizes constant planning, understanding, upgrading, team partnership, development, and delivery. The agile process is fragmented into separate models that teams work on, thereby encouraging flexibility to changes. By definition, Agile methodology, a variety of project management approach, that is confirmedly deployed for software development, also where requirements and solutions unfold via the collaborative work of self- systemized and cross-functional teams and their users. Types of Agile Methodology There are various types of agile methodology available in the market to suit every project\u2019s wants. 1. Agile Scrum Methodology Scrum is a lightweight framework of Agile Project Management, it can be adopted to conduct iterative and all types of incremental projects. One of the most popular agile methodology examples is the agile scrum development methodology, which is depicted by various cycles of development and has specific characteristics like simplicity, sustained productivity, and strength for blending several underlying approaches adopted by other agile methods. Scrum breaks down the development phases into stages or cycles called \u2018sprints\u2019. The development time for each sprint is maximized and dedicated, thereby managing only one sprint at a time. Scrum and agile methodologies focus on continuous deliverables, and thus this method lets designers adjust priorities to ensure that any incomplete or overdue sprints get more attention. The hands-on system under Scrum includes easy steps and elements, that are the following : * Product owner , who creates an estimated wish list that is identified as a product backlog. * Scrum team , that takes one little part of the top wish list, termed as Sprint Backlog and work out in order to implement it. * After that scrum team concludes their sprint backlog task in a Sprint , i.e., a period of 2-4 weeks. In addition to that, the progress of their work can be accessed through a meeting that is called Daily Scrum . * The Scrum Master maintains the team focused toward their targets. * At the end of a sprint, the task is able to represent or transmit, and team finishes that particular sprint with a review and feedback and initiates with a new one. 2. Lean It is the iterative, agile methodology that directs the team on addressing customer values by compelling value stream mapping, although, it is a deeply adaptable, emerging methodology with the absence of solid guidelines, laws, or methods. The fundamental principles of Lean including; Uninterrupted advancement, Respect for other people, Eradicate waste, Rapid delivery, Knowledge-making and Defer commitment. Lean gives the authority of decision-making to every individual and small teams as it is considered as the most faster and effective method in comparison to the hierarchical flow of control. It focuses on the proficient implementation of team resources and assures to make everyone as productive as possible for maximum time. 3. Kanban Originating from the Japanese language, the translation of the word \u2018Kanban\u2019 is \u201cvisual board or signboard\u201d and is connected to the concept of \u201cjust in time\u201d! Projects through Kanban are overseen with the help of the Kanban Board, which is divided into columns to depict the process flow of the software development. This helps in increasing visibility teams as the teams can see the progress through every stage of development and prepare for the upcoming tasks to deliver the product \u201cjust in time\u201d! This method requires thorough interaction and transparency to enable the team members to be equipped with the right stage of the development at any time and have a cohesive flow of work at all times. Similar to Scrum, Kanban is the process developed for supporting collaborative teamwork more effectively. It works adequately on three principles; For visualizing what to perform today , i.e, workflow automation, that specifies all the elements, under the context of each other, could be very informative. For bounding the quantity of work in progress to maintain harmony in the flow-based approach, so that teams can\u2018t begin and commit extra work at once. For boosting flow , like, when some task is about to complete, the next priority would be item into play from the backlog. 4. Extreme Programming(XP) Extreme Programming (XP) is a methodology that emphasizes teamwork, communication, and feedback. Generally being used with Scrum, it can focus on how Agile can increase customer satisfaction, instead of delivering at the entirety, the customer seeks for the near future, it provides them what they demand at present. Similar to scrum, this method also uses sprints or short development cycles. This is developed by a team to create a productive and highly efficient environment. Extreme Programming technique is very supportive in a situation of constant and varying demands from the customers. It motivates the developers to accept changes in the customer\u2019s demands, even if they pop-up in an advanced phase of the development process. In Extreme Programming, the project is tested from the initial stages by collecting feedback that progresses the output of the system. This also presents a spot check to implement easily any customer requirements. XP method is basically based on the four simple values: * Uniformity, * Simplicity * Communication, * Feedback and * Endurance. 5. Crystal In actual, the Crystal Methodology is a class of small agile methodologies that incorporate Crystal Clear, Crystal Yellow, Crystal Red and many more. Every methodology has its own specific framework that is characterized by factors such as system criticality, team size, and project priorities. Depending on the nature of the project or system criticality such as Comfort (C), Essential Money (E), Discretionary Money (D), and Life (L), the kind of crystal agile methodology is chosen. It is introduced by Alistair Cockburn while participated in writing the Agile manifesto for software development. Including three factors that define that traits of a project are team size, system seriousness, and project preferences where projects are categorized into four levels, based on the system criticality, that are; * Comfort (C), * Discretionary Money (D), * Essential Money (E), and * Life (L). Depending on the size of the project, the most number of people can be involved in the project, i.e., gigantic the project, more the people involved. If the project is large, many roles can be accounted for and vice versa. Moreover, crystal methodology is converged on interaction, people, expertise, communication, skills, and community. 6. Dynamic System Development Method (DSDM) To address the need for a standard industry charter for the swift delivery of software, the Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) was developed. DSDM gives a comprehensive structure that is defined and modified to create a plan, execute, manage, and scale the procedure of software development. However, this is iterative, incremental and Rapid Application Development(RAD) methodology. The framework of DSDM incorporates feasibility and business studies, prototype iteration and functional model, design and develop iteration, and deployment. Basically, DSDM works on eight principles, that guide the team and build a perspective for delivering a product on time and under budget, are : * To converge on the business requirement, * Deliver on time, * Collaborate, * Nevermore negotiate quality, * Create incrementally from firm associations, * Expand iteratively, * Communicate frequently and clearly, and * Manifest control. Based on a business-driven approach and eight principles, the DSDM believes that modifications to the project are always expected, and quality with timely delivery must never be negotiated. 7. Feature Driven Development (FDD) Being an iterative and accumulative development process, FDD is a lightweight, agile methodology to develop software. It mixes various industry-established best practices into united as a whole. These practices are encouraged in terms of a feature-first perspective while aiming at creating values for the client. However, the main purpose lies in delivering stable, working software frequently on time. The five core activities under FDD involve; * Designing an entire model, * Making features lists, * Designing, * Developing and * Building through features. FDD is a constructive, arranged, centred method for the entire software workflow management and a reliable choice for software-focused teams and associations. Differences between Agile and Scrum Agile is a philosophy, whereas Scrum is a type of Agile methodology Scrum is broken down into shorter sprints and smaller deliverables, while in Agile everything is delivered at the end of the project Agile involves members from various cross-functional teams, while a Scrum project team includes specific roles, such as the Scrum Master and Product Owner","title":"Methodologies"},{"location":"software-development-methodologies/agile-methodologies/#what-is-agile-methodology","text":"Agile method is an iterative and incremental tactic to software design that utilizes constant planning, understanding, upgrading, team partnership, development, and delivery.

BDD is considered an effective technical practice especially when the problem space of the business problem to solve is complex. Principles of BDD BDD specifies that tests of any unit of software should be specified in terms of the desired behavior of the unit. BDD, also related to how the desired behaviour should be specified. BDD specified business analysis and developer should collaborate and should specify behaviour in terms of user stories.

An attack is one of the biggest security threats in information technology, and it comes in different forms. A passive attack is one that does not affect any system, although information is obtained. A good example of this is wiretapping. An active attack has the potential to cause major damage to an individual\u2019s or organization\u2019s resource because it attempts to alter system resources or affect how they work. A good example of this might be a virus or other type of malware. 1. Site Mapping The first technique an attacker will typically use against is your site is site mapping.

Authentication - Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user. - Authentication addresses the question: \"Who is this user?\" - It is the process of uniquely identify the clients of your applications and services. b. Authorization - Authorization is the process of verifying the permissions of a user. - Authorization addresses the question: \"What can this user do?\" - It is the process that governs the resources and operations that the user is permitted to access and operate. c. Auditing - Effective auditing and logging is the key to non-repudiation (denial of truth). - It guarantees that a user cannot deny performing an operation or initiating an transaction. d. Confidentiality - It refers to the privacy of data. - It is a process of making sure that data remains private and confidential and that it cannot be viewed by unauthorized users. - Encryption is frequently used to enforce confidentiality. e. Integrity - It is the guarantee that data is protected from accidental or malicious modification. - Integrity for data in transmission is typically provided by hashing techniques ad message authentication ports. f.

White List Input Valdation Whitelist validation is the practice of only accepting input that is known to be good. This can involve validating compliance with the expected type, length or size, numeric range, or other format standards before accepting the input for further processing. Escaping all user supplied input. Escaping all user supplied input is the practice of escaping all user supplied input before passing it to the database. While escaping, the input is converted to a format that is safe for the database to process.

The terms maintaining state and/or managing state refer to keeping track of the condition of the process. The Internet is intrinsically stateless because each request for a new Web page is processed without any knowledge of previous pages requested. This is one of the chief drawbacks to the HTTP protocol. Because maintaining state is extremely useful, programmers have developed a number of techniques to add state to the World Wide Web. These include server APIs, such as NSAPI and ISAPI, and the use of cookies. In simple words, Web is stateless. Server doesn't care what page or what order is requested. Web has no built mechanism that specifies which sequence of webpages and forms are presented to user. This aspect of web is statelessness. Concerns regarding state: What if our service require certain order ? What if server must keep track of requests ? How can developer achieve statefulness ? Acheive Statefulness Hidden Fields Hidden fields are used to store data that is not visible to the user. Changing the values of those fields may change the behavior of the application. These fields may contain information like: user name, session id, etc. GET or POST parameters ( Common Gateway Interface - CGI ) GET parameters are used to pass data to the server through query parameters in unencrypted form. POST parameters are used to pass data to the server through request body in encrypted form. If we alter those parameters, the behavior of the application may change. Cookies Cookies Poisoning Changing the values of the cookie. Sessions Session Hijacking Gaining access to another user's session. Cookie Poisoning It is a technique that allows an attacker to trick a user into using a malicious cookie. By this technique, is an attack strategy in which the attacker alters, forges, hijacks, or otherwise \"poisons\" an otherwise valid cookie sent back to a server to steal data, bypass security, or both. Cookie A cookie is a piece of information that gets added to a user's device when they visit a website. It records their preferences as they use the website and is retrieved later by websites and web servers to do the following: authenticate the user's identity; speed up transactions - for example, on banking or e-commerce websites; monitor user behavior; auto fill personal information on web forms; track items in shopping carts; and streamline user experiences. Types of Cookies Session, or nonpersistent cookies last only as long as the user's website session and expire when the user leaves the website. Persistent cookies last beyond the life of a single session. They are created to recognize users when they return to a website and to deliver a personalized user experience with every visit. How do cookies work? As mentioned earlier, the data stored in the cookie lets the web server know the history of the website's interaction with a particular user. This enables the website to display the correct information for that user. Let's visualize a scenario to understand the role of cookies: A user enters login credentials on a website. The site's server verifies the credentials and authenticates the login. Subsequently, the server logs the session in a database, and a cookie containing the session ID is returned to the browser. The process of verifying the session ID in the cookie data with the database continues on every subsequent request until the user logs out. Once the user logs out, the session is automatically destroyed on the client and server However, the cookie data continues to remain on the user's hard disk -- meaning the cookie persists -- if they have checked the Remember me or Keep me logged in options. How cookie poisoning works Cookie poisoning happens when unauthorized persons (attackers) can manipulate cookies due to the poor security infrastructure of a website. By editing or manipulating the cookie, the attacker can gain access to the user data stored in the cookie. Cookie poisoning attacks are dangerous because they enable attackers to use the data stored inside cookies to gain unauthorized access to users' accounts or to steal their identities. Session hijacking, session spoofing and session fixation Cookie poisoning attacks usually target user session cookies. Cookie-based attacks against sessions aim to fool the web server into thinking that the attacker is the legitimate user. Examples of such attacks include the following: Session hijacking . When a legitimate user is logged in to a website, attackers use their knowledge of the current session cookie to take over the user's session. Session spoofing . Attackers use stolen or forged session tokens to start a new session and impersonate the legitimate user. This type of attack requires no user interaction and can be initiated even when the user is not logged in to the website. Session fixation . Attackers send a known session identifier via a phishing email or other means and fool a legitimate user into using this identifier to log in to a vulnerable or malicious site. The attacker then hijacks the user session.","title":"State Based Attacks"},{"location":"software-security/state-based-attacks/#acheive-statefulness","text":"Hidden Fields Hidden fields are used to store data that is not visible to the user.

It is the layer that handles the user interaction with the application. The presentation layer provides necessary data to the client\u2019s side. It receives input data, processes users\u2019 requests, sends them to data services and puts results to the browser. With Java EE, It is handled with JSP, JS, HTML and CSS. Components: User interface (UI) components These components provide the mechanism for users to interact with the application. They format data and render it for display, and acquire and validate data entered by users. UI process components To help synchronize and coordinate user interactions, it can be useful to drive the process using separate UI process components. This prevents the process flow and state management logic from being hard-coded into the UI elements themselves, and allows you to reuse the same basic user interaction patterns in other user interfaces. Data Source Layer The data source layer is the layer that handles the data services. This is where the data arrives at your organization. Information is stored and received from a database or file system. The information is passed back to the logic tier for processing, and then eventually back to the user. With Java EE, It is handled with JDBC, Hibernate, JPA. Domain Logic & Business Logic Layer The domain logic layer is the layer that handles the business logic.

Web Architecture with Java EE Servlet \ud83d\udd25 It is a technology that is used to create enterprise web application. Servlet is an API that provides many interfaces and classes including documentation. Servlet is an interface that must be implemented for creating any Servlet. Servlet is a class that extends the capabilities of the servers and responds to the incoming requests. It can respond to any requests. Servlet is a web component that is deployed on the server to create a dynamic web page. Advantages of Servlet Better performance: because it creates a thread for each request, not process. Portability: because it uses Java language. Robust: JVM manages Servlets, so we don't need to worry about the memory leak, garbage collection, etc. Secure: because it uses java language.

Step 2 Develop the web resources ( HTML File, CSS File, Servlet File). Step 3 Develop the deployment descriptor ( web.xml ). Step 4 Compile the Java file. Step 5 Deploy the web application. Step 6 Start Server and access using the web browser. Folder Structure Life Cycle public void init(Servlet config) throws ServletException config : It is a configuration object that contains the information about the servlet. It is called only once. It is called only when Servelet is created and not called when any user requests the servlet. The init() method simply creates or load some data that will be used throughout the information of the servlet. public void service(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException request : It is a request object that contains the information about the request. response : It is a response object that contains the information about the response. It is called when any user requests the servlet. It is called for each request. It is the main method to perform the actual task. The Servlet container (i.e. webserver) calls the service() to handle incoming request and write the formatter and response back to the client. Each time the server receives the request for a servlet, the server create a new thread to handle the request. It checks the HTTP request type ( GET, POST, PUT etc) and calls the appropriate method ( doGET(), doPOST(), doPUT() ). When we have nothing to do with service(), we can use the doGET() , doPOST() method. public void destroy() It is called when the servlet is destroyed. It is called only once at the end of the lifecycle of the Servlet. This method gices your Servlet a chance to clean up any resources that it may have created like: database connections, file handles, etc. How do you design business logic in yout app using Java EE?

The pattern requires that each of these be separated into different objects. The Model contains only the pure application data, it contains no logic describing how to present the data to a user. The View presents the model\u2019s data to the user. The view knows how to access the model\u2019s data, but it does not know what this data means or what the user can do to manipulate it. The Controller exists between the view and the model. It listens to events triggered by the view (or another external source) and executes the appropriate reaction to these events. In most cases, the reaction is to call a method on the model. Since the view and the model are connected through a notification mechanism, the result of this action is then automatically reflected in the view. Advantages Multiple developers can work simultaneously on the model, controller and views. MVC enables logical grouping of related actions on a controller together. The views for a specific model are also grouped together. Models can have multiple views. Disadvantages The framework navigation can be complex because it introduces new layers of abstraction and requires users to adapt to the decomposition criteria of MVC. Knowledge on multiple technologies becomes the norm. Developers using MVC need to be skilled in multiple technologies. DAO and DTO objects DTO Data Transfer Objects. It is used to transfer the data between classes and modules of your application. These are generally used to transfer data from controller to client (JS). Term is also used for POCOs/POJOs by few which actually holds the data retrieved from Database. DTO should only contain private fields for your data, getters, setters, and constructors. DTO is not recommended to add business logic methods to such classes, but it is OK to add some util methods. DAO Data Access Objects. It should encapsulate the logic for retrieving, saving and updating data in your data storage (a database, a file-system, whatever). Data Access Object is one of the design patterns used to implement DAL. This builds and executes queries on database and maps the result to POCO/POJO using various other patterns including 'Query Object', 'Data Mapper' etc. DAO layer could be further extended using 'Repository' pattern. DAL Data Access Layer It abstracts your database activities using DAO/Repository/POCO etc. ORMs help you to build your DAL but it could be implemented without using them also. interface PersonDTO { String getName (); void setName ( String name ); //..... } interface PersonDAO { PersonDTO findById ( long id ); void save ( PersonDTO person ); //..... } POJO Plain Old Java Objects. A hand-wavy way of describing \"normal\" non-enterprise Java Objects. It's just a fancy name for a very basic class structure. POJO is not recommended to add business logic methods to such classes, but it is OK to add some util methods. Example \ud83d\udd25 To implement web application based on MVC design pattern.

We\u2019ll create an Employee Registration module using JSP, Servlet, JDBC, and MySQL database. MYSQL Database Setup Let's create a database named employee in MySQL. Let's create an employee table using below DDL script: CREATE TABLE ` employee ` ( ` id ` int ( 3 ) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT , ` name ` varchar ( 100 ) DEFAULT NULL , ) ; Model Layer Let's create the Employee class which will act as our Model class. This can be view as POJO (Plain Old Java Objects) class. # Employee.java public class Employee { private String name ; Employee ( String namen ) { this . name = name ; } public String getName () { return this . name ; } public void setName ( String name ) { this . name = name ; } } DAO Layer Let's create EmployeeDAO class that contains JDBC code to connect with the MySQL database. # EmployeeDAO.java import java.sql.Connection ; import java.sql.DriverManager ; import java.sql.PreparedStatement ; import java.sql.SQLException ; public class EmployeeDAO { private static final String JDBC_URL = \"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/employee\" ; private static final String JDBC_USER = \"root\" ; private static final String JDBC_PASSWORD = \"root\" ; private static final String JDBC_DRIVER = \"com.mysql.jdbc.Driver\" ; public int registerEmployee ( Employee employee ) throws ClassNotFoundException , SQLException { String INSERT_USERS_SQL = \"INSERT INTO employee (name) VALUES (?);\" ; Class . forName ( JDBC_DRIVER ); Connection connection = DriverManager . getConnection ( JDBC_URL , JDBC_USER , JDBC_PASSWORD ); PreparedStatement preparedStatement = connection . prepareStatement ( INSERT_USERS_SQL ) preparedStatement . setString ( 1 , employee . getName ()); // ID is auto-incremented, so no need to set it. System . out . println ( preparedStatement ); int result = preparedStatement . executeUpdate (); return result ; } } Controller Layer Let's create an EmployeeServlet class to process HTTP request parameters and redirect to the appropriate JSP page after request data stored in the database: # EmployeeServlet.java import java.io.IOException ; import javax.servlet.ServletException ; import javax.servlet.annotation.WebServlet ; import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet ; import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest ; import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse ; @WebServlet ( name = \"EmployeeServlet\" , urlpatterns = { \"/register\" }) public class EmployeeServlet extends HttpServlet { private EmployeeDAO employeeDao ; public void init () { employeeDao = new EmployeeDAO (); } protected void doPost ( HttpServletRequest request , HttpServletResponse response ) throws ServletException , IOException { String name = request . getParameter ( \"name\" ); Employee employee = new Employee ( name ); try { employeeDao . registerEmployee ( employee ); } catch ( Exception e ) { e . printStackTrace (); } response . sendRedirect ( \"employeeRegisterSuccess.jsp\" ); } } View Layer Let's design an employee registration HTML form with the following fields: - firstName - lastName # employeeRegister.jsp < %@ page language=\"java\" contentType=\"text/html; %> <!DOCTYPE html> < html > < head > < title > Register Employee </ title > </ head > < body > < h1 > Employee Register Form </ h1 > < form action = \"<%= request.getContextPath() %>/register\" method = \"post\" > < table style = \"width: 80%\" > < tr > < td > Name </ td > < td >< input type = \"text\" name = \"name\" placeholder = \"Name\" /></ td > </ tr > </ table > < input type = \"submit\" value = \"Submit\" /> </ form > </ body > </ html > After an employee successfully registered then this page show a successful message on screen: # employeeRegisterSuccess.jsp < %@ page language=\"java\" contentType=\"text/html; %> <!DOCTYPE html> < html > < head > < title > Employee Register Success </ title > </ head > < body > < h1 > User successfully registered! </ h1 > </ body > </ html >","title":"MVC Pattern"},{"location":"web-application-architecture/mvc-pattern/#advantages","text":"Multiple developers can work simultaneously on the model, controller and views.
